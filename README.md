# Atom Syntax Highlighting

## How to install

Open your terminal and go to:  
 `cd ~/.atom/packages/`

You just need to clone the package inside the folder:  
`git clone https://github.com/damdamo/language-alpine.git`

Now, if you create a file with one of these extension: *.alp*, *.alpine*, you should have syntax highlighting if you open an alpine file in atom.
